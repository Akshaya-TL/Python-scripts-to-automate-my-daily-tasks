This script is written to enhance the readabilty of the file, as it seemed to be too clumsy to go through from an excel file. <br/>
Many times, we may come across files which when converted to other format would be much easier to read and understand. <br/><br/>
If you have an excel file of similar kind, perform the following steps - <br/>
**step 1** - save the file as .csv <br/>
**step 2** - Alter the column names, file names based on your requirement <br/><br/>
