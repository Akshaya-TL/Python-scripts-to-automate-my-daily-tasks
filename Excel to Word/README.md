#Excel to word
This script is written to enhance the readabilty of the file, as it seemed to be too clumsy to go through from an excel file.
Many times, we may come across files which when converted to other format would be much easier to read and understand. 
If you have an excel file of similar kind, perform the following steps - 
step 1 - save the file as .csv 
step 2 - Alter the column names, file names based on your requirement
Finally you can excecute to automate your tasks too !!!
